I started programming 8088 processor in assembler and basic. I physically handled punch cards and magnetic tapes for code storage. Impact printers were my 'printing' terminal for viewing my code and code execution results display.  I learned C versions, LISP/PROLOG and wrote a few programs in these languages. HP taught me HPUX.  UNIX/LINUX continues to be useful to me decades later.  That's how old I am in computer years. Since then I have self learned coding in Java, and now want to learn Python; to  see what I can design and code for use in  AI systems development projects.

All of my neighbors have drinking habits, though I am not familiar with their local haunts or specific methods of ingestion. I prefer to drink alone, and code in public.
